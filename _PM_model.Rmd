# PM_model Object Generator

PM_model is an object factory that would generate the right object representation based on the parameters supplied.

## Legacy runs

For legacy runs it is enough to provide the path to the model file to PM_model, it would create a PM_model_legacy object that can be interpreted by PM_fit.

```{r echo=F, results='asis'}
data <- "data.csv"
model <- Pmetrics::PM_model("model.txt")

pk_problem <- Pmetrics::PM_fit$new(data,model)
```

In general, is possible just to pass the path tho de model file directly to the PM_fit$new(...) function. It would automatically detect that it is a legacy run and will call the PM_model function automatically.

```{r echo=F, results='asis'}
pk_problem <- Pmetrics::PM_fit$new(model = "model.txt", data = "data.csv")
```

## Non-legacy runs

TBD
